# This question is asked by Google.

# You are given a bag of coins, an initial energy of E,
# and want to maximize your number of points (which starts at zero).

# To gain a single point you can exchange coins[i] amount of energy
# (i.e. if I have 100 energy
# and a coin that has a value 50 I can exchange 50 energy to gain a point).

# If you do not have enough energy you can give away a point in exchange
# for an increase in energy by coins[i] amount
# (i.e. you give away a point and your energy is increased by the value of that
# coin: energy += coins[i]).

# Return the maximum number of points you can gain.

# NOTE: Each coin may only be used once.

# Ex: Given the following coins and starting energyâ€¦
# coins = [100, 150, 200] and E = 150, return 1
# coins = [100,200,300,400] and E = 200, return 2
# coins = [300] and E = 200, return 0
