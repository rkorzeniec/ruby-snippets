# frozen_string_literal: true

# Create a class CallCounter that tracks the number of calls a client
# has made within the last 3 seconds.
# Your class should contain one method, ping (int t) that receives the current
# timestamp (in milliseconds) of a new call being made and returns the
# number of calls made within the last 3 seconds.
#
# NOTE: you may assume that the time associated with each subsequent
# call to ping is strictly increasing.

# Ex: Given the following calls to pingâ€¦

# ping(1), return 1 (1 call within the last 3 seconds)
# ping(300), return 2 (2 calls within the last 3 seconds)
# ping(3000), return 3 (3 calls within the last 3 seconds)
# ping(3002), return 3 (3 calls within the last 3 seconds)
# ping(7000), return 1 (1 call within the last 3 seconds)
